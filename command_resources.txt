-----------------------------Setting up the database from TheMealDB-----------------------------

1. Make sure your git is up to date with my stuff on the sprint 1 branch, so 
    git pull origin sprint1

2.1 The script relys on 'requests' to be downloaded. I added the 'requests' stuff into the requirements.txt now, 
but you can check in your terminal with:
    pip show requests


2.1 If it turns out you do not have it installed, run:
    pip install requests



3. You should be good to try running the custom script to populate the database. The script I made 
is in cookapp/management/commands/fetch_meals. Run the following:
    python manage.py fetch_meals



----------------------Setting up ENHANCED database-------------------------------


Getting Started Guide: Recipe Project Setup

Follow these steps to clear old data, set up the database, and load recipes using the OpenAI API.

1. Install OpenAI Requirements

   First, install the OpenAI API library. Run this in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

2. Run Database Migrations

   Update the database with recent model changes:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. Clear Old Data

   Clean out old, incompatible data:

   ```bash
   python manage.py clear_database
   ```

4. Set Up the OpenAI API Key

   Obtain your OpenAI API key (provided by me) and set it as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
   ```

   *Make sure to keep the single quotes (``).*

5. Fetch Recipe Data

   Load recipes with OpenAI (Note: This process will take approximately 30 minutes as it generates recipes one by one):

   ```bash
   python manage.py fetch_meals
   ```

   You’ll see a final confirmation message like `301 Recipes successfully created` once complete.

After these steps, you’ll be ready to access the recipes via the site’s interface! Yippee!
