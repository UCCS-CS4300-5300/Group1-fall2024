This is where useful documentation will be stored.  :)

-----------------------------Setting up the database from TheMealDB-----------------------------

1. Make sure your git is up to date with my stuff on the sprint 1 branch, so 
    git pull origin sprint1

2.1 The script relys on 'requests' to be downloaded. I added the 'requests' stuff into the requirements.txt now, 
but you can check in your terminal with:
    pip show requests


2.1 If it turns out you do not have it installed, run:
    pip install requests



3. You should be good to try running the custom script to populate the database. The script I made 
is in cookapp/management/commands/fetch_meals. Run the following:
    python manage.py fetch_meals



----------------------Setting up ENHANCED database-------------------------------

1.)         So there's a minor update to the models, so start with:

    python manage.py makamigrations
    python manage.py migrate

2.)         Next, you need to clear out the bad data from the old database. I made a custom command for this:

    python manage.py clear_database

3.)         Now we'll look to set up the database command. You'll need an openai api key for this. I'll give you each the key 
            personally since github doesn't allow you to store it. After I give you the key, run this command:

    export OPENAI_API_KEY='API_KEY_HERE'

            Of course replace API_KEY_HERE with the key given. Make sure to leave the '' though.

4.)         Now you should be good to run the command to update the database again:

    python manage.py fetch_meals

            This will take around 30 minutes since each recipe is calling GPT, getting a response, and creating json stuff 300 times. :/

5.)         When it's done it should give you some notification like "301 Recipes succesfully created"
